## 🔄 Active Maintenance Loop
| Cadence | Task | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Per commit | Run `npm run lint`, `npm run type-check`, `npm run build` | Dev team |
| Daily | Monitor GitHub Actions, review PRs/issues | Maintainer |
| Weekly | Review Lighthouse scores, address regressions | Dev + Design |
| Monthly | Security audit (`npm audit`, dependency updates) | Maintainer |
| Quarterly | UX feedback sessions, roadmap update | Product + Community |

## 🚧 Backlog & Enhancements
- [ ] **Google Maps integration** for richer pickup/delivery selection.
- [ ] **Stripe payments** for secure courier payouts.
- [ ] **Push notifications** (web + mobile) for status updates.
- [ ] **In-app messaging** between customer and courier.
- [ ] **Photo proof** uploads for pickup/drop-off confirmation.
- [ ] **Courier ratings & reviews** to build trust.
- [ ] **Admin console** for support and moderation.
- [ ] **Multilingual support** starting with ES/FR.

---

## 🧪 Testing Playbook
- `npm run lint` → Static analysis
- `npm run type-check` → TypeScript guarantees
- `npm run build` → Production compilation
- `npm run start` → Smoke test production server
- Manual mobile walkthrough on iOS Safari + Android Chrome + desktop
- Verify CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`) passes on push

---

## 🚀 Deployment Pathways
1. **Vercel** (`vercel --prod`) – primary hosting, zero-config.
2. **Docker Compose** (`docker-compose up -d`) – app + MongoDB stack.
3. **Railway / Render / AWS** – documented in `DEPLOYMENT.md`.

Ensure `.env.production` values are set:
```
MONGODB_URI=
JWT_SECRET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
```

## 📚 Key References
- `README.md` – product overview & quick start.
- `docs/API.md` – endpoint specs and examples.
- `PRODUCTION-READY.md` – go-live checklist.
- `TEST-RESULTS.md` – full manual test log.
- `PIPELINE-FIXED.md` – CI/CD status & setup.
- `FINAL-STATUS.md` – accomplishment summary.

---

## 🤝 Collaboration Guidelines
- Create issue → branch (`feature/...`) → open PR with checklist.
- Ensure CI passes before requesting review.
- Use conventional commits (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, etc.).
- Document changes in `CHANGELOG.md` under _Unreleased_.

---

## 🛡️ Quality Guardrails
- Enforce branch protections on `master`/`main`.
- Require at least one review per PR.
- Keep dependencies updated (Dependabot or manual monthly pass).
- Run security scans before each release.
- Snapshot Lighthouse scores before/after major UI work.

---

## 📆 Next Review
Schedule a roadmap check-in for **November 15, 2025** to:
- Prioritize backlog items based on user feedback.
- Assess performance metrics and runtime logs.
- Plan incremental releases (v1.1, v1.2...).
