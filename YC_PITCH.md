# Courier Connect – Y Combinator Pitch

## What is Courier Connect?
Courier Connect is a global, mobile-first platform that instantly connects people who need something delivered or picked up with local, verified couriers. No customer registration, no technical jargon—just seamless, friendly delivery for everyone, everywhere.

## Problem
Millions of people need help picking up, delivering, or buying items—gifts, marketplace purchases, forgotten documents. Existing solutions are slow, require registration, or are limited to specific cities. Couriers want flexible, well-paid work, but lack a simple way to find jobs nearby.

## Solution
Courier Connect lets anyone request a delivery in seconds, without creating an account. Couriers register, get verified, and earn 70% of every job. The platform is available in all EU, North & South American countries, and adapts to each user's language and culture. Pricing is transparent, calculated by distance, urgency, and time. Real-time maps, notifications, and payments make the experience effortless.

## Why Now?
