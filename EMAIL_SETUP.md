## Option 3: Squarespace Email Marketing (Not for Regular Email)

If you only need to send marketing emails and newsletters:

1. Use Squarespace Email Campaigns
2. Set up in your Squarespace dashboard
3. No additional DNS configuration required

This is NOT for receiving emails or day-to-day communication.

## Option 4: Email Forwarding

If you just need a professional email address that forwards to your existing email:

1. Use a service like [ImprovMX](https://improvmx.com/) (free plan available)
2. Add their MX records to your Squarespace DNS settings
3. Configure forwarding addresses

Example setup:
- Forward info@hostilian.org â†’ your-personal-email@gmail.com
- Send emails from your Gmail but they appear as from info@hostilian.org

## DNS Records for Email

When setting up email, you'll need to add these record types:

1. **MX Records**: Direct email to the correct mail server
2. **SPF Records**: Prevent email spoofing
3. **DKIM Records**: Email authentication
4. **DMARC Records**: Reporting and conformance

Your email provider will give you the exact values to use.

## Important Notes

- Email setup is separate from your website hosting
- Vercel doesn't provide email hosting
- You can use different services for website (Vercel) and email (Google/Zoho)
- Always set up proper SPF/DKIM records to avoid spam filtering issues
- Test your email setup thoroughly before using it for important communication
