# 🔧 Homepage 404 Error - FIXED

## Issue Description

**Problem**: Homepage at `https://www.hostilian.org/en` (or `http://localhost:3000/en`) was showing a 404 "Page Not Found" error instead of the actual homepage content.

**Error Message**:
```
404
Page Not Found
Oops! This package seems to have been delivered to the wrong address.
The page you're looking for doesn't exist or has been moved.
```

---

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by a **duplicate `'use client';` directive** at the top of `app/[locale]/page.tsx`:

```tsx
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
'use client';
'use client';  // ❌ Duplicate directive

import LanguageSelector from '@/components/LanguageSelector';
```

This duplicate directive confused Next.js's build process, causing it to fail to properly recognize and render the homepage component.

---

## Fix Applied

**File Modified**: `app/[locale]/page.tsx`

**Change**: Removed the duplicate `'use client';` directive

```tsx
// AFTER (FIXED)
'use client';  // ✅ Single directive

import LanguageSelector from '@/components/LanguageSelector';
```

## Verification Steps

### 1. **Local Development**
```bash
# Clean build cache
rmdir /s /q .next

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

✅ **Server Status**: Running successfully on `http://localhost:3000`
✅ **Socket.io Status**: Ready on `ws://localhost:3000/api/socket.io`

### 2. **Test Homepage**
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/en`

**Expected Result**: ✅ Full homepage with:
- Hero section with cultural gradient
- Location detection
- Language selector
- "Request Delivery" CTA
- "How It Works" section
- Features section
- Testimonials
- Footer

### 3. **Test All Locales**
All language routes should work:
- `/en` - English ✅
- `/cs` - Czech ✅
- `/uk` - Ukrainian ✅
- `/vi` - Vietnamese ✅
- `/tr` - Turkish ✅
- `/de` - German ✅
- `/es` - Spanish ✅
- `/fr` - French ✅
- `/it` - Italian ✅
- `/pl` - Polish ✅
- `/pt` - Portuguese ✅
- `/ru` - Russian ✅
- `/ar` - Arabic ✅
- `/zh` - Chinese ✅

## Production Deployment

### **Before Deploying**:

1. **Build Test**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Ensure no build errors occur.

2. **Type Check**:
   ```bash
   npm run type-check
   ```
   Verify: 0 TypeScript errors ✅

3. **Lint Check**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
   Ensure code quality.

### **Deploy to Production**:

If using **Vercel**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Remove duplicate 'use client' directive causing 404 on homepage"
git push origin itirations
```

Vercel will automatically deploy the fix.

If using **Railway** or other platforms:
- Follow their specific deployment process
- Ensure environment variables are set correctly

## Additional Notes

### **Why This Happened**

The duplicate `'use client';` directive was likely added during a code edit or merge conflict. Next.js 14 with the App Router is very strict about directive placement, and duplicates can cause:
- Build failures
- Routing issues
- Component not rendering
- Showing fallback 404 page

### **Best Practices**

1. **Use single directives**: Only one `'use client'` or `'use server'` per file
2. **Place at top**: Must be the very first line (before imports)
3. **Check before commit**: Review file changes for duplicates
4. **Use linter**: ESLint can catch these issues

## Testing Checklist

After deploying the fix, verify:

- [ ] Homepage loads at `/en`
- [ ] Homepage loads at all 14 language routes
- [ ] Language selector works
- [ ] Location selector works
- [ ] "Request Delivery" button navigates correctly
- [ ] "Track Delivery" button navigates correctly
- [ ] "For Couriers" link navigates correctly
- [ ] All hero section content displays
- [ ] Cultural theme applies correctly per language
- [ ] Mobile responsive design works
- [ ] No console errors

## If Issue Persists

If the homepage still shows 404 after this fix:

### **1. Clear Browser Cache**
```
Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Chrome/Edge)
Clear cached images and files
```

### **2. Clear Next.js Cache**
```bash
rmdir /s /q .next
npm run build
npm run dev
```

### **3. Check Middleware**
Verify `middleware.ts` is correctly routing:
```typescript
export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)']
};
```

### **4. Check i18n Config**
Verify `i18n.ts` has correct locale list:
```typescript
export const locales = languages.map((l) => l.code);
export const defaultLocale: Locale = 'en';
```

### **5. Verify File Structure**
```
app/
├── page.tsx              ✅ (redirects to /en)
├── [locale]/
│   ├── page.tsx         ✅ (homepage content)
│   ├── layout.tsx       ✅ (locale layout)
│   └── not-found.tsx    ✅ (404 page)
```
