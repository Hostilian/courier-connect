## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### 1. Payment Escrow System (COMPLETE ✅)

Implemented a **full-featured payment escrow system** with automatic fund holding and release. This was the #1 highest-priority missing feature.

#### Key Components Built:

**Backend (6 APIs)**:
- ✅ Modified `/api/payments/create-checkout-session` for manual capture (escrow)
- ✅ Enhanced `/api/payments/webhook` with payment intent handlers
- ✅ Updated `/api/deliveries/update-status` with auto-release on delivery
- ✅ Created `/api/payments/release` for manual payment capture
- ✅ Created `/api/stripe/connect/onboard` for courier onboarding
- ✅ Created `/api/stripe/connect/dashboard` for Express Dashboard access

**Database Updates (2 models)**:
- ✅ User model: Added `stripeAccountId` and `stripeOnboardingComplete`
- ✅ DeliveryRequest model: Enhanced `paymentStatus` enum + `paymentCapturedAt`

**Frontend (1 component)**:
- ✅ Created `StripeConnectOnboarding` component (3 states: not onboarded, pending, complete)
- ✅ Integrated into courier dashboard

**Translations**:
- ✅ Added 20+ translation keys under `courier.stripe.*`

**Documentation**:
- ✅ `PAYMENT_ESCROW_COMPLETE.md` - 400+ line comprehensive guide
- ✅ `PAYMENT_ESCROW_SUMMARY.md` - Executive summary

## 💰 How the Escrow System Works

### The Flow in 7 Steps:

1. **Customer creates delivery** → Status: `unpaid`
2. **Customer pays** → Stripe authorizes (holds) funds → Status: `authorized` ✅ **ESCROW**
3. **Courier accepts** → Status: `accepted`
4. **Courier picks up** → Status: `picked_up`
5. **Courier in transit** → Status: `in_transit`
6. **Courier delivers** → **AUTOMATIC MAGIC** ✨
   - System captures payment from escrow
   - 70% transferred to courier's Stripe account
   - 30% retained by platform
   - Status: `paid`
7. **Money in bank** → Everyone happy 🎉

### Key Innovation: Zero Manual Processing

When delivery is marked as `delivered`, the system **automatically**:
1. Calls `stripe.paymentIntents.capture()` - Funds move from escrow to platform
2. Calls `stripe.transfers.create()` - Sends 70% to courier's bank
3. Updates courier's earnings balance
4. Sets `paymentCapturedAt` timestamp

**No admin intervention. No delays. Just code doing its job.** 🤖
