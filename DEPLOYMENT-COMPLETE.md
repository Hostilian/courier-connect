## 🔧 Next Steps

### 1. Watch Pipeline Execute (Now!)
```
→ Go to: https://github.com/Hostilian/courier-connect/actions
→ See: CI/CD Pipeline - Production Grade workflow
→ Monitor: All 7 jobs executing
→ Result: ✅ All green = Success!
```

### 2. Configure Custom Domain (15 mins)
```
Action: Add DNS records at domain registrar

A Record:
  Name:    @
  Value:   76.76.21.21
  TTL:     Auto

CNAME Record:
  Name:    www
  Value:   cname.vercel-dns.com
  TTL:     Auto

Then: Add domain in Vercel dashboard
Wait: 15 mins - 48 hours for propagation
Result: SSL certificate auto-provisions
```

### 3. Add Environment Variables (5 mins)
```
Go to: https://vercel.com/hostilianns-projects/courier-connect/settings/environment-variables

Add:
  MONGODB_URI:   mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/courier-connect
  JWT_SECRET:    (64-character random string)

Optional:
  NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY: (for maps)
  NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: (for payments)
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: (for payments)
```

### 4. Make Repository Public (Optional)
```
Option A - GitHub UI:
  Settings → General → Danger Zone → Change visibility → Public

Option B - GitHub CLI:
  gh repo edit Hostilian/courier-connect --visibility public
```

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Pipeline Performance
```
Target:    < 16 minutes total
Jobs:      7 comprehensive stages
Parallel:  Yes (where possible)
Caching:   Enabled (faster runs)
```

### Quality Thresholds
```
TypeScript:    0 errors required
ESLint:        0 critical errors
Security:      0 high vulnerabilities
Lighthouse:    > 90 mobile score
Build:         Successful compilation
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Pipeline Fails

#### Code Quality Job:
```bash
# Run locally to debug
npm run type-check
npm run lint
npm run format
```

#### Build Job:
```bash
# Test build locally
npm run build
```

#### Security Job:
```bash
# Check vulnerabilities
npm audit
npm audit fix
```

#### Deploy Job:
- Check environment variables in Vercel
- Verify MONGODB_URI is set
- Verify JWT_SECRET is set
