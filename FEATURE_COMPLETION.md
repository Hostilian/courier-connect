## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database & Models
- ✅ Updated `DeliveryRequest` model with scheduling fields (`scheduledPickupDate`, `scheduledDeliveryDate`)
- ✅ Added distance/route tracking fields (`distance`, `duration`, `routePolyline`)
- ✅ Added price breakdown fields (`courierEarnings`, `platformFee`, `basePrice`, `distancePrice`, etc.)
- ✅ Extended `urgency` enum to include `'scheduled'` option

### 2. Pricing Algorithm
- ✅ Created `lib/pricing.ts` with complete pricing engine
- ✅ Implemented 70/30 profit split (courier gets 70%, platform gets 30%)
- ✅ Base price: $3.00

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing

- ✅ Change package size → Price should update with multiplier
- ✅ Try scheduling in past → Should show validation error
- ✅ Try scheduling <2 hours ahead → Should show error
- ✅ View pricing breakdown → Courier earnings should be exactly 70%
- ✅ Submit delivery → Success screen shows correct earnings split

### API Testing

```bash
# Test distance calculation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/maps/distance \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"origin": "Prague Castle", "destination": "Wenceslas Square"}'

# Test pricing calculation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/pricing/calculate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"distance": 10, "urgency": "express", "packageSize": "medium"}'

# Get pricing config
curl http://localhost:3000/api/pricing/calculate
```

### Translation Testing
