# üîß 404 ERROR FIX - RESOLVED

## Issue
When accessing `http://localhost:3000`, the application showed a 404 error page instead of redirecting to the default locale homepage.

## Root Cause
The dev server needed to be restarted after all the recent code changes. Next.js had stale build cache from previous changes.

## Solution
**Restarted the development server** with `npm run dev`, which cleared the cache and picked up all recent changes.

## Correct URL Structure
Due to the `localePrefix: 'always'` configuration in middleware, all routes MUST have a locale prefix:

### ‚úÖ Correct URLs:
- `http://localhost:3000/en` - English homepage
- `http://localhost:3000/es` - Spanish homepage
- `http://localhost:3000/fr` - French homepage
- `http://localhost:3000/cs` - Czech homepage
- `http://localhost:3000/de` - German homepage
- ... (all 14 languages)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Root Redirect:
- `http://localhost:3000/` - Automatically redirects to `/en` (default locale)

## Why This Configuration?
The `localePrefix: 'always'` configuration ensures:
1. **SEO benefits**: Each language has its own URL path
2. **Clear language identification**: Users always know which language they're viewing
3. **No language detection confusion**: Explicit language selection
4. **Shareable URLs**: Each language version has a unique, shareable link

## Verification
After restart, accessing:
- `http://localhost:3000` ‚Üí Redirects to `http://localhost:3000/en`
- `http://localhost:3000/en` ‚Üí Shows English homepage ‚úÖ
- All locale routes work correctly

## Status
‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Application is now working correctly on all locale routes.

## Additional Notes

### Environment Configuration
The `.env.local` file is properly configured with:
- ‚úÖ MongoDB connection (Atlas cluster)
- ‚úÖ JWT secret (128 characters, secure)
- ‚úÖ App URL (localhost:3000)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Resend API key (empty - email features disabled)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Google Maps API key (empty - maps features disabled)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Stripe keys (not configured - payment features will use test mode or be disabled)

### For Production Deployment
When deploying to production:
1. Use the production MongoDB URI
2. Add all optional API keys for full functionality
3. Use Stripe LIVE keys (not test keys)
4. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to `https://hostilian.org`
