# 404 Page Fix & Usability Improvement

## Overview
This document outlines the fixes made to address the 404 "Page Not Found" issue and improve the overall usability of error pages in Courier Connect.

## Changes Made

### 1. Root Not-Found Page Update
Updated `app/not-found.tsx` to:
- Include all language options dynamically from the language configuration
- Add a "Track a Package" button alongside "Go to Homepage"
- Improve animations with `animate-pulse` for better visual feedback
- Organize language flags in a responsive flex layout
- Ensure consistent styling with the rest of the application

### 2. Middleware Enhancement
Modified `middleware.ts` to:
- Use a wrapped function approach for better control over routing
- Enable potential custom handling of routes and redirects
- Maintain all existing internationalization functionality
- Preserve correct locale handling for all routes

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users encountering a 404 error now have:
   - Clear navigation options to go to homepage or tracking
   - Multiple language choices with visual flag indicators
   - Consistent brand experience even on error pages

2. **Complete Language Support**: All 14+ languages are now properly represented with their flags

3. **Improved Error Recovery**: Users have more intuitive options to continue their journey on the platform

## Deployment & Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Deploy the latest changes to Vercel
2. Test the 404 page by navigating to non-existent routes:
   - Root level: `https://hostilian.org/non-existent-page`
   - Localized: `https://hostilian.org/en/non-existent-page`
   - Deep paths: `https://hostilian.org/en/category/missing-path`

3. Verify language selection works from the 404 page
4. Confirm that all buttons function correctly
5. Test on mobile devices to ensure responsive behavior

## Cultural Considerations

The 404 page now respects the cultural theming principles of Courier Connect:
- Default theme uses warm yellow/orange gradient
- When accessed through a localized route, it uses the appropriate cultural theme
- All language options are presented equally, reinforcing the international focus
