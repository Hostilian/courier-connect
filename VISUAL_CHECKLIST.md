### 💰 **"Algorithm to calculate price, 70% to courier, 30% to website"**
```
✅ COMPLETE

Pricing Formula:
─────────────────────────────────────────
Base Price:      $3.00
Distance:        $0.80 per km
Package Size:    Small (1x), Medium (1.2x), 
                 Large (1.5x), XL (2x)
Urgency:         Standard (1x), Express (1.5x),
                 Urgent (2x), Scheduled (0.9x)
─────────────────────────────────────────
Total = (Base + Distance × Size) × Urgency

Split:
Courier:   70% ($X.XX)
Platform:  30% ($Y.YY)

Example:
10 km, medium package, express
= ($3 + $8) × 1.2 × 1.5 = $19.80
Courier gets: $13.86 (70%)
Platform gets: $5.94 (30%)
