# üí≥ Payment Escrow System - Complete Implementation Guide

## Overview

The **Payment Escrow System** is now fully implemented, enabling secure payment handling with automatic fund holding and release. This system ensures customers pay upfront, funds are held safely in escrow, and couriers are paid automatically upon delivery confirmation.

---

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Payment Authorization (Escrow)**
- Customer pays when creating delivery request
- Funds are **authorized but not captured** (held in escrow)
- Stripe PaymentIntent created with `capture_method: 'manual'`
- Payment status: `pending` ‚Üí `authorized`

### 2. **Automatic Payment Capture**
- When courier marks delivery as `delivered`, payment is **automatically captured**
- Funds are transferred from escrow to platform
- Payment status: `authorized` ‚Üí `paid`

### 3. **Automatic Courier Payout**
- After payment capture, system automatically transfers 70% to courier's Stripe Connect account
- Platform keeps 30% as fee
- Courier's earnings balance is updated

### 4. **Stripe Connect Integration**
- Couriers onboard via Stripe Connect Express
- Simple onboarding flow directly in dashboard
- Access to Stripe Express Dashboard for payout management

```

---

### Production Testing

**Prerequisites**:
```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...  # From live webhook endpoint
```

**Webhook Setup**:

## üí∞ Money Flow Example

**Delivery Price**: $15.00

### 1. Customer Pays
- $15.00 authorized (held in escrow)
- NOT yet in platform's balance

### 2. Delivery Marked as Delivered
- $15.00 captured from escrow ‚Üí Platform's Stripe balance
- Immediately triggers transfer:
  - **Courier receives**: $10.50 (70%)
  - **Platform keeps**: $4.50 (30%)

### 3. Final State
- Delivery `paymentStatus`: `paid`
- Delivery `paymentCapturedAt`: `2025-10-20T15:30:00Z`
- Courier `earnings`: +$10.50
- Platform net: $4.50

---

## üîê Security Features

1. **Manual Capture**: Funds can't be captured before delivery confirmation
2. **Webhook Verification**: All webhook events verified with signature
3. **Authorization Checks**: Only delivery's courier can trigger payment release
4. **Idempotency**: Multiple capture attempts are handled safely
5. **Error Handling**: Failed transfers don't block delivery confirmation

---

## üö® Error Handling

### Payment Capture Fails
- Delivery status still updates to `delivered`
- Payment remains in `authorized` state
- Admin can manually capture via Stripe Dashboard or `/api/payments/release`

### Transfer to Courier Fails
- Payment is still captured (customer is charged)
- Transfer can be retried manually
- Courier's earnings still updated (for tracking)
- Error logged for admin review

### Courier Not Onboarded
- Payment is captured successfully
- Transfer is skipped (courier doesn't have connected account)
- Funds remain in platform account
- Courier can onboard later and request payout

---

## üìä Monitoring & Admin

### Check Payment Status
```typescript
// Get delivery
const delivery = await DeliveryRequest.findOne({ trackingId: 'CC-ABC123' });

console.log('Payment Status:', delivery.paymentStatus);
console.log('Payment Intent:', delivery.paymentIntentId);
console.log('Captured At:', delivery.paymentCapturedAt);
```

### Check Courier Earnings
```typescript
const courier = await User.findById(courierId);

console.log('Total Earnings:', courier.earnings);
console.log('Stripe Account:', courier.stripeAccountId);
console.log('Onboarding Complete:', courier.stripeOnboardingComplete);
```

### Stripe Dashboard Links
- **Test Mode**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test
- **Live Mode**: https://dashboard.stripe.com
- **Webhooks**: Developers ‚Üí Webhooks
- **Payments**: Payments ‚Üí All payments
- **Transfers**: Connect ‚Üí Transfers

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: Payment stuck in "authorized" state
**Solution**: Manually capture via Stripe Dashboard or call `/api/payments/release`

### Issue: Courier not receiving transfer
**Check**:
1. Is courier's `stripeOnboardingComplete` true?
2. Is courier's `stripeAccountId` set?
3. Check Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Connect ‚Üí Transfers for errors

### Issue: Webhook not firing
**Check**:
1. Webhook secret correct in `.env`?
2. Webhook endpoint accessible (not localhost in production)?
3. Stripe CLI forwarding events (for local testing)?

### Issue: "Insufficient funds" error on transfer
**Cause**: Platform Stripe balance doesn't have enough funds
**Solution**: Payment must be captured BEFORE creating transfer (our flow does this)

---

## üéâ Success Metrics

After implementation, you can now:

‚úÖ **Customer POV**: Pay upfront, funds held safely until delivery
‚úÖ **Courier POV**: Get paid automatically upon delivery confirmation

3. **Dispute System**: Handle Stripe disputes with evidence upload
4. **Payout Schedule**: Allow couriers to set weekly/monthly payout schedule
