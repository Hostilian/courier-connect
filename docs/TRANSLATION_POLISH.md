## 🇨🇿 Czech (cs) Improvements

### ✅ Current Quality: GOOD
The Czech translations are natural and use appropriate formal register.

### Minor Improvements Suggested:

1. **"Vaše Jméno" → "Vaše jméno"**
   - Czech typically uses lowercase for common nouns unless at start of sentence
   - Current: Capitalized (acceptable, formal)
   - Suggested: Lowercase (more natural)
   - **Priority: LOW** (current is fine)

2. **"Dokončit Dodávku" → "Dokončit doručení"**
   - "Dodávka" can mean delivery service or delivery vehicle
   - "Doručení" is more precise for delivery action
   - **Priority: LOW** (both acceptable)

3. **Consistency Check:**
   - "Objednat Dodávku" (request page)
   - "Objednat Dodávku Nyní" (CTA button)
   - ✅ Consistent usage is good

### Cultural Notes:
- Czech users appreciate direct, no-nonsense language
- Current tone strikes good balance between formal and friendly
- Bohemian crystal theme (red-blue-white) resonates well

## 🇺🇦 Ukrainian (uk) Improvements

### ✅ Current Quality: EXCELLENT
Ukrainian translations are accurate with proper Cyrillic and apostrophes.

### Minor Improvements Suggested:

1. **"Стати кур'єром" → Keep as is**
   - Apostrophe in "кур'єром" is correct
   - Some systems might render as "курєром" (wrong) - verify rendering

2. **"Потрібна інша локація?" → More casual alternative:**
   - Current is formal/literal
   - Alternative: "Шукаєте інше місто?" (Looking for another city?)
   - **Priority: LOW** (current is fine)

3. **Regional Variants:**
   - Current uses standard Ukrainian (літературна мова)
   - No need for regional variants (Western/Eastern)
   - ✅ Good choice for nationwide service

### Cultural Notes:
- Blue-yellow theme is powerful and resonates strongly
- Embroidery patterns (вишивка) are deeply cultural
- Current tone is warm and professional—perfect for post-2022 sentiment

## 🇻🇳 Vietnamese (vi) Improvements

### ✅ Current Quality: VERY GOOD
Vietnamese translations use natural colloquial language.

### Improvements Suggested:

1. **"Shipper" vs "Người giao hàng"**
   - Current: Uses "shipper" (English loanword)
   - Context: "Shipper" is **preferred** in Vietnam for gig economy workers
   - "Người giao hàng" sounds formal/old-fashioned
   - ✅ **Current is correct** - keep "shipper"

2. **"Đặt Giao Hàng" → Consider alternatives:**
   - Current: "Đặt Giao Hàng" (Order delivery)
   - Alternative: "Đặt đơn" (Place order) - more casual
   - **Priority: LOW** - current is clear and professional

3. **Regional Dialect:**
   - Current uses Northern dialect (Hà Nội standard)
   - Southern (Sài Gòn) would use different vocabulary
   - For nationwide app, Northern/Central is safe choice
   - ✅ **Current is good**

4. **Tone Marks Rendering:**
   - Verify: ă, â, ê, ô, ơ, ư with all tone marks (5 tones)
   - Test: "Tiếng Việt", "Giao Hàng", "Người Gửi"
   - Ensure web fonts support full Vietnamese charset

### Cultural Notes:
- Red-yellow (national flag colors) work well
- Lantern/lotus patterns are festive and positive
- Vietnamese users appreciate efficiency and clear pricing
- Use of "shipper" shows cultural awareness of gig economy

## 🇹🇷 Turkish (tr) Improvements

### ✅ Current Quality: GOOD
Turkish translations are grammatically correct with proper dotted İ/i.

### Improvements Suggested:

1. **"Kurye ol" → "Kurye olun" (More formal)**
   - Current: "ol" (informal imperative)
   - Formal: "olun" (formal imperative)
   - **Context:** CTA buttons can be informal for friendliness
   - **Decision:** Keep "ol" for approachable tone
   - Alternative for super-formal contexts: "Kurye Olun"

2. **"Teslimat İste" → Verify capitalization**
   - İ with dot (correct): "İste"
   - I without dot (wrong): "Iste"
   - ✅ Current uses İ correctly

3. **Vowel Harmony Check:**
   - "Teslimatı Takip Et" (accusative -ı is correct)
   - "Kuryeleri Gör" would use -i (front vowel)
   - ✅ Current follows vowel harmony rules

4. **Colloquial vs Formal:**
   - "Takip et" (informal) vs "Takip edin" (formal)
   - Current mixes: "İste" (formal implied) + "ol" (informal)
   - **Recommendation:** Consistently use informal for CTAs, formal for instructions
   - Priority: MEDIUM

### Cultural Notes:
- Red-white-gold (Turkish flag + Ottoman gold) resonate
- Tulip motifs are historically significant (Lale Devri)
- Turkish users value efficiency and trust indicators
- Informal tone ("sen") is common in modern Turkish apps
- Government/bank apps use formal "siz"—we're in the middle

### Specific Changes to Make:

```json
// Current
"becomeCourier": "Kurye ol"

// Options:
"becomeCourier": "Kurye Ol"      // Title case, informal (RECOMMENDED)
"becomeCourier": "Kurye Olun"    // Formal
"becomeCourier": "Kurye olun"    // Formal, lowercase
```

**Recommendation:** Keep current "Kurye ol" but ensure consistency across all CTAs.
