# GitHub Actions Setup Guide

## ✅ Current Pipeline Status

Your CI/CD pipeline is now configured to work without requiring GitHub secrets initially. It will:

1. ✅ **Lint & Test** - Runs on every push and PR
2. ✅ **Build** - Verifies the project builds successfully
3. ℹ️ **Deploy** - Ready to enable when you add Vercel secrets

---

## 🔧 How the Pipeline Works Now

### On Every Push/PR:
```yaml
✅ Checkout code
✅ Setup Node.js 20
✅ Install dependencies
✅ Run ESLint (continues on error)
✅ Build project (with test environment variables)
```

### Environment Variables for CI Build:
- `MONGODB_URI`: Uses localhost MongoDB (for build only, not runtime)
- `JWT_SECRET`: Uses test secret (for build only)

---

## 🚀 Optional: Enable Vercel Auto-Deploy

If you want automatic deployments to Vercel, add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

### Step 1: Get Vercel Credentials

1. Install Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. Link your project:
   ```bash
   vercel link
   ```

3. Get your tokens:
   ```bash
   # This creates .vercel directory with project info
   cat .vercel/project.json
   ```

### Step 2: Add GitHub Secrets

Go to: **GitHub Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**

Add these secrets:
- `VERCEL_TOKEN` - Your Vercel token (get from vercel.com/account/tokens)
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID` - From `.vercel/project.json` (orgId)
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` - From `.vercel/project.json` (projectId)

### Step 3: Update Workflow (Optional)

If you add the secrets, you can uncomment the Vercel deployment steps in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`.

---

## ✅ Package is Now Public

Your `package.json` has been updated:
```json
"private": false
```

This means:
- ✅ Repository can be public
- ✅ Package can be published to npm (if you want)
- ✅ Others can fork and use your code

---

## 🎯 What Happens on Push

When you push to GitHub:

1. **GitHub Actions triggers** automatically
2. **Installs dependencies** with `npm ci`
3. **Runs linter** to check code quality
4. **Builds the project** to verify it compiles
5. **Shows success/failure** on your commits

---

## 🔍 Check Pipeline Status

After pushing:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on **"Actions"** tab
3. See your workflow runs
4. Green ✅ = Success
5. Red ❌ = Failed (check logs)

---

## 🐛 If Pipeline Fails

### Common Issues:

**1. Lint Errors**
```bash
# Fix locally
npm run lint:fix
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve linting issues"
git push
```

**2. Build Errors**
```bash
# Test build locally
npm run build

# If it works locally but fails in CI:
# - Check that all files are committed
# - Verify no missing dependencies
```

**3. Missing Dependencies**
```bash
# Ensure package.json is up to date
npm install
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "chore: update dependencies"
git push
```

## 📝 Workflow File Location

Your CI/CD configuration is at:
```
.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
```

---

## 🎉 Benefits of This Setup

✅ **Automatic Quality Checks** - Every push gets linted and built  
✅ **Catch Errors Early** - Before deploying to production  
✅ **No Secrets Required** - Works out of the box  
✅ **Easy to Extend** - Add tests, deployments later  
✅ **Public Package** - Others can use your code

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Branch Protection**: Enable in GitHub Settings → Branches
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Require PR reviews

2. **Badge in README**: Show build status
   ```markdown
   ![CI](https://github.com/Hostilian/courier-connect/workflows/CI%2FCD%20Pipeline/badge.svg)
   ```

3. **Test Locally First**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run build
   npm run type-check
   ```

4. **Small Commits**: Push frequently to catch issues early

---

## 🚀 Ready to Push!

Your pipeline is configured and ready. Just push to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "ci: configure GitHub Actions pipeline"
git push origin master
```

Then watch it run in the **Actions** tab! 🎊
